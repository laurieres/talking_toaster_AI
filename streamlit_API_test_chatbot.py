            #question : My dishwasher is making an unusual noise.

            answer = f"""DISHWASHER - NORMAL / ABNORMAL NOISES
There are many sounds you may hear when your dishwasher is in use. Some sounds are normal while others may be abnormal. Abnormal sounds sometimes have easy solutions to eliminate the sound. Here are some of the normal and abnormal sounds you may hear and suggestions to correct abnormal sounds.



The following is a list of Normal sounds:

Clicking or Grinding Sound in the Control: Dishwasher models with a Timer (Knob) control and some models with electronic controls will make clicking sounds as the dishwasher progresses through its cycle.

Some models of dishwashers with electronic controls have a motor driven electrical switching device in the control panel. This type of sound will be heard when the dishwasher is changing cycles; for example, when the dishwasher moves from circulation mode to pump-out mode. The sound is normal.

Humming: The dishwasher motor may make on and off humming sounds during operation that are normal. This sound occurs because:

The fan that cools the main pump motor is rotating.

The soft food disposer may be grinding up food waste.

The drain pump may be operating.

Pausing During Drain: The drain pump starts and stops several times during each drain. This helps pump out food debris more effectively. If your dishwasher pauses briefly or seems to start and stop during the draining period, this is normal operation.

Snapping Sound While Running:

Throughout the Cycle: A dishwasher fills and drains several times during the wash and rinse portions of the cycle. Each time it begins to drain a solenoid energizes which causes a definitive snapping sound. This will happen several times during each cycle and is dependent on the model and options selected. This is normal. Some models do not have drain solenoids, so this sound will not be heard on all models.

Loud Snap Mid-Cycle: It is normal to hear a snapping sound when the detergent cup opens.

Snapping When Opening the Door: It is normal to hear a snapping sound when the detergent cup opens as it hits the door or upper rack.

On flip cover detergent cups: The cover only opens to a 90-degree angle when in the wash cycle. When the door is opened at the end of the cycle, you may hear a snap as the cup opens fully. The sound is normal.

On some models: You may hear a snap from the door latch as you open and close the dishwasher. This is normal.

Swishing or Sloshing: The dishwasher will make a swishing noise as the water is sprayed around inside the tub during the wash and rinse portions of the cycle.

Whining Noise: The dishwasher wash pump motor can make a whining sound when operating. This is normal."""
